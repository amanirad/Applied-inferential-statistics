# Applied Statistical Inference


The current repository is for the projects of the Applied Statistical Inference course of the second semester 1402-1403 at SBU. For now, the first phase of the projects is defined here that all students must do all the projects with full details in the same Jupyter Notebook R file related to that project (codes and descriptions-interpretations of the codes, as well as conclusions, should be carefully added together in that file). Note that the data for each project is also uploaded here.

The deadline for this first phase of the projects is Sunday, April 5, 2024, (17 Farvardin 1403) at 11:59 PM Tehran time and will not be extended in any way.
