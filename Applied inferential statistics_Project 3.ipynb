    "A researcher ran a study in which participants were required to recall a list of words. The conditions varied in terms of whether subjects simply counted the number of letters in a word, thought of a rhyming word, thought of an appropriate adjective, created images of the word, or was told to study the words for later recall. The dependent variable was the number of words recalled on a test trial. These data are shown below.\n",

The two other groups were Older subjects who were given tasks requiring either Low or High levels of processing. The data are found in https://github.com/amanirad/Applied-inferential-statistics.\n",
