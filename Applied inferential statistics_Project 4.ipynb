    "In a study of memory processes, animals were tested in a one-trial avoidance-learning task. The animals were presented with a fear-producing stimulus on the learning trial as soon as they stepped across a line in the test chamber. The dependent variable was the time it took them to step across the line on the test trial. Three groups of animals differed in terms of the area in which they had electrodes implanted in their cortex (Neutral site, Area A, or Area B). Each group was further divided and given electrical stimulation 50, 100, or 150 milliseconds after crossing the line and being presented with the fear-inducing stimulus. If the brain area that was stimulated is involved in memory, stimulation would be expected to interfere with memory consolidation and retard learning of the avoidance response, and the animal should not show any hesitancy in recrossing the line. The data on latency to recross the line are as follows:\n",

    "Three researchers ran a study comparing different treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They used three groups (plus a waiting list control). One group received Stress Inoculation Therapy (SIT), another received a Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment, and a third received standard Supportive Counseling (SC). All clients were measured at Pretreatment, Posttreatment, and a 3.5-month Follow-up. The data below closely approximate the data that they collected, and the dependent variable is a measure of PTSD.\n",
